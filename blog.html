                <p><span class="font-bold">let:</span> The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable,
                    optionally initializing it to a value.
                    Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
                    usually denoted by
                    curly braces {}.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">var:</span> The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable,
                    optionally initializing it to a
                    value.
                    Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in.
                    Global variables are
                    available throughout your entire code.
                    <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">const:</span> The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant
                    variable, i.e. a variable that
                    can't be reassigned.
                    Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that's a bit of a misnomer since they are
                    actually variables - just
                    ones that can't be reassigned.
                    <br>
                    The var keyword is the oldest way of declaring variables in JavaScript and is supported by all
                    browsers. The let and
                    const keywords are newer additions to the language and are not supported by older browsers. If you
                    need to support older browsers, you can use var instead of let or const. If you don't need to
                    support older
                    browsers, you can use let or const. If you want your variable to be immutable, use const. Another
                    difference between var and let/const is that var variables are function-scoped, while let and const
                    variables
                    are block-scoped. This means that var variables are only available within the function they were
                    declared in. On the other hand, let and const variables are only available within the block they
                    were declared in.

                    JavaScript
                </h1>
                <p><span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span> keyword is one of the most used keywords in
                    JavaScript. But
                    when it comes to regular functions
                    and arrow functions, it behaves in entirely different ways. In regular function, <span
                        class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span> changes
                    according to the way that function is invoked. But, in the arrow functions, the behavior of
                    <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span> changes completely.

                    Arrow functions don't have their own <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span>, and they
                    don't
                    redefine the value of <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span> within the function. In
                    regular JavaScript functions, arguments keywords can be used to access the passed arguments when the
                    function is
                    invoked. But, arrow functions do not have their own arguments and it uses the arguments from the
                    outer function.

                    The behavior of the arguments keyword within an arrow function is similar to the behavior of <span
                        class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">this</span>
                    keyword we discussed
                    earlier, and it is resolved lexically. As well know, we can easily construct objects with regular
                    functions. We just need to invoke the function with the new
                    keyword. However, arrow functions can not be used as constructors. Since this keyword is resolved
                    lexically in arrow functions, we cant use it to construct objects. In regular functions, we can use
                    the <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">return</span> keyword to return any value from a
                    function. If we don't return anything,
                    the function will implicitly return <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">undefined</span>. Arrow
                    functions behave in the same way when returning values. But there is one advantage you can take from
                    it.

                    If the arrow function contains one expression, you can omit the curly braces, and then the
                    expression will be implicitly
                    returned.

                    and returns the
                    element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.</p>

                <h1 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Template Strings in JavaScript</h1>
                <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables
                    and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
                    allows us to create
                    strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template
                    strings are tags.
                    Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are
                    great for converting
                    strings to different entities.

                    The syntax for creating template strings is by using backticks to delimit them. For example, we can
                    write: <span class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">`This is a string`</span>
                    We insert a variable or expression by adding a dollar sign <span
                        class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">$</span> and curly braces <span
                        class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">{}</span> into the string <span
                        class="bg-slate-200 font-semibold">`${variable}`</span>
                    . This is
                    much better than the alternative in old JavaScript where we had to concatenate a string. Another
                    great feature of template strings is that we can have strings with multiple lines for better code
                    readability.
                    This cannot be done in an easy way with the old style of strings. Template strings can be nested in
                    each other. This is a great feature because many people want to create dynamic
                    strings. Template strings allow us to nest regular strings or template strings within template
                    strings.
